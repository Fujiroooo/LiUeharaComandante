    One of the most important concepts in fighting games is offense. Without offense, fighting games would not exist, as you cannot attack the people that you are fighting. There are many kinds of offensive moves, like normal attacks, finishing or stronger attacks, and counterattacks. Of course, those are only some of the many moves you can do. Some games have complicated combination combos, while others are simpler. There may be also different styles of battle, or different characters with different movesets.
