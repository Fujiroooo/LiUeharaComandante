  <p id="defensedesc"> If there's offense, there's defense. Defense is a very important aspect of fighting games, because you need to be able to block or parry incoming attacks. In Tekken, you can block mid and high attacks by staying still, and low attacks by crouching. Some characters have the ability to parry attacks, like Jin and Law. </p>
